# Virtual-Calculator-Open-CV
**Overview**

I’m thrilled to share my latest project—a Virtual Calculator developed using OpenCV and Python! This project was an incredible journey that combined my passion for computer vision and software development.
<br>

**Features**

• Hand Gesture Recognition: Uses OpenCV to detect and interpret hand gestures.
<br>
• Virtual Buttons: Interactive buttons displayed on the screen for calculator operations.
<br>
• Real-time Processing: Processes video feed in real-time to perform calculations based on hand gestures.
<br>
• User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.
<br>

**Installation**

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/utkarshsingh68/Virtual-Calculator-Open-CV.git
<br>
cd virtual-calculator
<br>
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
<br>
Run the application:
python virtual_calculator.py

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Usage

**Run the application:**
python virtual_calculator.py

**Interact with the virtual calculator:**

Use hand gestures to interact with the virtual buttons.
<br>
Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**How It Works**

Hand Detection: Uses OpenCV to detect hand landmarks.
<br>
Gesture Recognition: Recognizes specific hand gestures to interact with virtual buttons.
<br>
Calculation: Performs calculations based on the recognized gestures and displays the result.
